# JunitTesting

## Overview

This project showcases my expertise in unit testing in Java by thoroughly testing a calculator with positive number limits. The primary goal is to verify if the calculator produces the correct output or returns an error when various numbers are input.

## Testing Scenarios

The unit tests cover a range of scenarios, including positive number limits, to ensure the calculator's functionality is robust and reliable. Each test case aims to validate the accuracy and resilience of the calculator under different input conditions.

## How to Run Tests

To run the unit tests, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the "JunitTesting" project folder.
2. Execute the relevant test runner or use your preferred IDE to run the JUnit tests.

## Key Features

- **Positive Number Limits:** Comprehensive testing with positive numbers to assess the calculator's behavior and accuracy.

## Learning Objectives

This project reflects my understanding and proficiency in:
- Implementing unit tests in Java using JUnit.
- Identifying and handling potential errors in a calculator application.
- Ensuring accurate and reliable functionality within specified limits.

## Acknowledgments

I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my unit testing skills through this project. The knowledge gained from creating and running these tests contributes to a deeper understanding of Java development practices.

Feel free to explore the test cases and their outcomes. Your feedback is valuable.

Thank you for your time and interest in this project.
